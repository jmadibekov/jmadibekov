### Hi there, my fellow developer ðŸ‘‹

I hope you're having a terrific day. I'm **Nurbakyt**, a software engineer with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I'm excessively passionate about programming. I plan to continue pursuing this passion as long as robots and AI don't take over the world (let's hope they won't)!

Previously, I had the opportunity to work as a software engineer at organizations such as [@Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/), [@Bloomberg](https://github.com/bloomberg), and [@ChocoFamily](https://github.com/chocofamilyme).

Stay safe and be kind.
